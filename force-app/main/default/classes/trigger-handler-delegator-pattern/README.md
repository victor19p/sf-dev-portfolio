# Trigger Framework (Kevin O'Hara)

One of the first popular trigger frameworks in Salesforce.

Allows:
- Consolidating trigger logic into specific classes
- Managing multiple objects in an organized way
- Reducing logic directly in the trigger

Although it doesn't include as many abstractions as others, it remains reliable and easy to implement.
